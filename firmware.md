# Firmware Issues
## Note
Creality's Stock firmware **is *really* bad**, so I'd recommend using the [E3V2/S1 professional firmware](https://github.com/mriscoc/Ender3V2S1/releases/latest) or even a custom build of Marlin.

Other than that, I haven't had any firmware related issues, since they've all been issues elsewhere manifesting themselves as a firmware problem (Z axis not moving down, etc.,)
